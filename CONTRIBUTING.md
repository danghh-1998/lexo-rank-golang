#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps.
- **Describe the behavior you observed** after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see** instead and why.
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
